# [Gender-Detection-Algorithm](http://rpubs.com/Aditi3110/gender_detection)
The purpose of this project is to build an algorithm for detecting the gender of a person from the image of his/her face. It uses a novel [Dynamic Time Warping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_time_warping) distance metric to classify images.
